Belieeeeeve when I say

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say

Tell me whyyyy
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me whyyyy
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me whyyyy
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
Am I, your fiiiiire?
Your one, desirrrre
Yes I know, it's tooooo late
But I waaant it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why,
I never want to hear you say
I waaaant it that waaay
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeeeeeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of meeeeeeeeeeee
You are my fiiiire
The one desiiiire
You are (you are, you are, you are)
Don't want to hear you say
Ain't nothin'
